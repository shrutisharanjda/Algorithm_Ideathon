Maximum Sum Subsequence of length k
Given an array sequence [A1, A2 …An], the task is to find the maximum possible sum of increasing subsequence S of length k such that S1<=S2<=S3………<=Sk.

Examples:

Input :
n = 8 k = 3
A=[8 5 9 10 5 6 21 8]
Output : 40
Possible Increasing subsequence of Length 3 with maximum possible sum is 9 10 21
